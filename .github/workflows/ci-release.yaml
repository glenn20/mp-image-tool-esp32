name: Publish and Release

#   A github reusable workflow to:
#   - Run code checks and tests on multiple python versions and platforms;
#   - Publish a python package to test.pypi.org and pypi.org; and
#   - Create a GitHub Release.
#
#   The workflow is triggered on:
#   - push to version tags matching "v*", eg. "v1.0.0", or
#   - manual workflow_dispatch (eg. from the github `Actions` tab):
#     - will produce a release with a version tag like: "v1.0.1.devN"
#
#   Uses reusable workflows from the <https://github.com/glenn20/python-ci>
#   repository.
